## Objective

Show the understanding and the ability to manage the different databases that we saw in the semester, as well as the concepts related to API's, ETL's, etc.

## Approach

Look for some API that attracts the attention of the team, with this API, connect it through python with a MongoDB database. Subsequently, make an ETL that loads the processed database into a graph-style database; Evidently the transformations and the subsets of data occupied will be different for each database since each one has different fines.

## Deliverables

The project must be as reproducible as possible, so a complete repository must be delivered on github, with the upload scripts and instructions on how to use the implemented utilities.

In addition, at least 3 interesting queries are required with respect to each database (6 in total), which explain a little more the phenomenon that the database is representing.
