## Objective

That the students show the understanding and the ability to manage the different databases that we saw in the semester, as well as the concepts related to API's, ETL's, etc.

## Approach

Look for some API that attracts the attention of the team, with this API, connect it through python with a MongoDB database. Subsequently, make an ETL that loads the processed database into a graph-style database; Evidently the transformations and the subsets of data occupied will be different for each database since each one has different fines.

## Deliverables

The project must be as reproducible as possible, so a complete repository must be delivered on github, with the upload scripts and instructions on how to use the implemented utilities.

In addition, at least 3 interesting queries are required with respect to each database (6 in total), which explain a little more the phenomenon that the database is representing.
